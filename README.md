# finding_donors
The project uses pre-defined data and applies several supervised learning methods to explore the most optimized ways to predict a donor. 
It starts from exploring the data by checking data features and distributions and transformation, and proceeds to calculating the naive prediction benchmarks. 
Then the selected supervised learning models are applied in order to select the most optimized model.
Feature selection is also applied in order to explore the importances among all feature and explore if it makes sense to keep more important ones and reduce data size.
